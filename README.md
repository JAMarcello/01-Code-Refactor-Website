## Refactoring Adjustments

- The <h1> element was simplified by removing the <span> to simply read "Horiseon".
- The CSS Style Sheet was also adjusted by combining the .header h1 code.
- A simple title was added in order to more accurately reflect the website.
- Accessible alt attributes were added for each image in the HTML.
